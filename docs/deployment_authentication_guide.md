# ProjectMeats Deployment Authentication Solutions
# ================================================

This guide addresses GitHub authentication issues during production deployment and provides multiple solutions.

## ðŸš¨ The Problem

If you encounter this error during deployment:
```
remote: Invalid username or token. Password authentication is not supported for Git operations.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/Vacilator/ProjectMeats.git/'
```

**This is because GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations (deprecated August 2021).**

## âœ… Solutions (Choose One)

### Solution 1: No-Authentication Deployment (Recommended)

Use our special deployment script that downloads the code without requiring GitHub authentication:

```bash
# On your production server
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vacilator/ProjectMeats/main/deploy_no_auth.sh | sudo bash
```

**This method:**
- âœ… No GitHub account needed
- âœ… No authentication setup required
- âœ… Downloads code via public GitHub APIs
- âœ… Falls back to multiple download methods
- âœ… Provides manual instructions if all else fails

### Solution 2: Personal Access Token (PAT)

If you prefer using `git clone`, set up a Personal Access Token:

#### Step 1: Create a PAT
1. Go to GitHub.com â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Set expiration (recommend 90 days)
4. Select scopes: `repo` (for private repos) or `public_repo` (for public repos)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)

#### Step 2: Use PAT for Deployment
```bash
# On your production server
git clone https://<YOUR_USERNAME>:<YOUR_TOKEN>@github.com/Vacilator/ProjectMeats.git
cd ProjectMeats
sudo ./deploy_production.py
```

Replace:
- `<YOUR_USERNAME>` with your GitHub username
- `<YOUR_TOKEN>` with the PAT you created

### Solution 3: SSH Key Authentication

Set up SSH keys for seamless authentication:

#### Step 1: Generate SSH Key on Server
```bash
# On your production server
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@domain.com"
# Press Enter for default file location
# Optionally set a passphrase

# Display your public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

#### Step 2: Add SSH Key to GitHub
1. Copy the output from the `cat` command above
2. Go to GitHub.com â†’ Settings â†’ SSH and GPG keys
3. Click "New SSH key"
4. Paste your public key
5. Click "Add SSH key"

#### Step 3: Use SSH for Deployment
```bash
# On your production server
git clone git@github.com:Vacilator/ProjectMeats.git
cd ProjectMeats
sudo ./deploy_production.py
```

### Solution 4: Download Release Package

Download a pre-packaged release:

```bash
# Create working directory
mkdir -p /tmp/projectmeats && cd /tmp/projectmeats

# Download latest release
curl -L https://github.com/Vacilator/ProjectMeats/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar -xz

# Move to installation directory
sudo mv ProjectMeats-main /home/projectmeats/app
sudo chown -R projectmeats:projectmeats /home/projectmeats
cd /home/projectmeats/app

# Run deployment
sudo python3 deploy_production.py
```

## ðŸ”§ Quick Troubleshooting

### If you get "Permission denied (publickey)"
Your SSH key isn't properly configured. Use Solution 1 (No-Authentication) or Solution 2 (PAT) instead.

### If you get "Repository not found"
- Check your GitHub username in the URL
- Verify the repository name is correct
- Ensure your PAT has the right permissions

### If download methods fail
Your server might have limited internet access. Try the manual method:

1. **On your local machine:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vacilator/ProjectMeats.git
   tar -czf projectmeats.tar.gz ProjectMeats/
   ```

2. **Transfer to server:**
   ```bash
   scp projectmeats.tar.gz root@YOUR_SERVER_IP:/tmp/
   ```

3. **On server:**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   tar -xzf projectmeats.tar.gz
   sudo mv ProjectMeats /home/projectmeats/app
   cd /home/projectmeats/app
   sudo python3 deploy_production.py
   ```

## ðŸš€ Recommended Deployment Flow

For the fastest, most reliable deployment:

```bash
# Step 1: Use no-authentication method
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vacilator/ProjectMeats/main/deploy_no_auth.sh | sudo bash

# Step 2: The script will guide you through the rest
# Follow the interactive prompts for your domain, database, etc.

# Step 3: Access your application
# Website: https://your-domain.com
# Admin: https://your-domain.com/admin/
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- **PATs**: Treat them like passwords. Store securely and rotate regularly.
- **SSH Keys**: More secure than PATs. Use ed25519 keys when possible.
- **No-Auth Method**: Downloads from public GitHub APIs. Safe and recommended.

## ðŸ“ž Still Having Issues?

If none of these solutions work:

1. Check if your server has internet connectivity: `curl -I https://github.com`
2. Verify DNS resolution: `nslookup github.com`
3. Check firewall settings: `sudo ufw status`
4. Try using a different DNS server: `echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf`

## âœ… Success Verification

After successful deployment, verify everything works:

```bash
# Check services are running
sudo systemctl status projectmeats nginx postgresql

# Test your website
curl -I https://your-domain.com

# Check admin access
curl -I https://your-domain.com/admin/
```
