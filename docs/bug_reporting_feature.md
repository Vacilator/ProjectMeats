## API Endpoints

### Bug Reports API
- `GET /api/v1/bug-reports/` - List bug reports (auth required)
- `POST /api/v1/bug-reports/` - Create new bug report
- `GET /api/v1/bug-reports/{id}/` - Get specific bug report
- `POST /api/v1/bug-reports/{id}/retry_github_creation/` - Retry failed GitHub creation
- `GET /api/v1/bug-reports/stats/` - Get bug report statistics
- `GET /api/v1/bug-reports/user_reports/` - Get current user's reports

### Permissions
- Regular users can only see their own bug reports
- Staff users can see all bug reports
- All authenticated users can create bug reports

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Set these in your `.env` file:

```bash
# GitHub Integration
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-personal-access-token
GITHUB_REPO=Vacilator/ProjectMeats
GITHUB_COPILOT_USERNAME=copilot
```

### GitHub Token Requirements
The GitHub token needs the following permissions:
- `repo` - Full repository access
- `issues` - Create and modify issues

## Error Handling

### GitHub API Failures

- Failed reports are marked with status "failed" and error message
- Manual retry available through API endpoint
- Graceful degradation ensures user experience is maintained

### Frontend Error Handling
- Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- Network errors are displayed to users
- Success feedback confirms submission
- Automatic modal closure after successful submission

2. Fill out the bug title and description (required)
3. Optionally add reproduction steps, expected/actual behavior
4. Upload screenshot if helpful
5. Submit - a GitHub issue will be created automatically

from apps.bug_reports.models import BugReport, BugReportPriority

bug_report = BugReport.objects.create(
    reporter=user,
    reporter_email=user.email,
    title="API endpoint returning 500 error",
    description="The /api/v1/suppliers/ endpoint is returning 500 errors",
