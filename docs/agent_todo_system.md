## Integration Points

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Validates agent orchestration system functionality
- Runs `agent_orchestrator.py project-status` and `agent_orchestrator.py list-tasks`
- Checks for this documentation file existence

### AI Deployment Orchestrator
- Handles complex deployment scenarios
- Provides intelligent failure recovery
- Delegates to GitHub Copilot when needed

### GitHub Integration
- Creates issues for failed deployments
- Monitors for resolution through commits and comments
- Automatic retry after fixes are implemented

## Monitoring and Alerting

The agent orchestration system monitors:
- CI/CD pipeline status
- Deployment health
- API endpoint availability
- Database connectivity
- Frontend build status
- Security scan results

## Configuration

Agent orchestration settings are managed through:
- Environment variables in CI/CD
- Configuration files in the project root
- GitHub Actions workflow settings
