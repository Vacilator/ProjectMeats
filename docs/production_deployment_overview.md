## ðŸ”§ Deployment Process

### Quick Start (5 Minutes)
1. **Choose Provider**: Run `python server_guide.py` for recommendations
2. **Configure Setup**: Run `python deploy_production.py` for guided configuration
3. **Deploy to Server**: Upload and execute generated deployment script
4. **Verify Deployment**: Run `python verify_deployment.py` for health checks

### Detailed Process

#### Step 1: Server Selection
```bash
# Get personalized server recommendations
python server_guide.py

# Follow provider-specific setup instructions
# Create Ubuntu 20.04+ server with 2-4 vCPU, 4-8GB RAM
```

#### Step 2: Interactive Configuration
```bash
# Run guided setup
python deploy_production.py

# Script will prompt for:
# - Deployment type (Production/Local/Development)
# - Domain name and SSL configuration
# - Database choice (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
# - Admin user credentials
# - Email configuration (SMTP)
# - Security settings
# - Advanced options (timezone, caching, etc.)
```

#### Step 3: Server Deployment
```bash
# Upload generated files to server
scp -r . user@your-domain.com:/home/projectmeats/setup

# SSH into server and run deployment
ssh user@your-domain.com
cd /home/projectmeats/setup
sudo ./deploy_server.sh
```

#### Step 4: Verification
```bash
# Run health checks
python verify_deployment.py

# Access your application
# https://your-domain.com (Frontend)
# https://your-domain.com/admin/ (Admin Panel)
# https://your-domain.com/api/docs/ (API Documentation)
```
