The ProjectMeats AI Orchestration System provides **complete end-to-end autonomous task management** with intelligent agent delegation and automatic GitHub issue creation for production failures.

## 🎯 System Overview

The orchestration system automatically:

1. **Detects production deployment failures** in real-time
2. **Creates emergency tasks** with appropriate priority levels
3. **Assigns tasks to best-suited AI agents** based on capabilities and workload
4. **Creates GitHub issues** with detailed error context and recovery suggestions
5. **Monitors task progress** and handles failures with retry/escalation logic
6. **Provides real-time monitoring** and comprehensive dashboards

## 🏗️ Architecture

export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="projectmeats.settings"
```

### Orchestration Settings

The management command supports various configuration options:

```bash
python manage.py run_orchestration \
  --interval 30 \                      # Task processing interval (seconds)
  --deployment-check-interval 60 \     # Deployment failure check interval
  --health-check-interval 300 \        # System health check interval
  --verbose \                          # Enable verbose logging
  --dry-run                           # Test mode (no actual changes)
```

## 📊 API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/orchestration/tasks/` - List tasks
- `POST /api/v1/orchestration/tasks/` - Create task
- `GET /api/v1/orchestration/agents/` - List agents
- `GET /api/v1/orchestration/status/dashboard/` - System dashboard
- `POST /api/v1/orchestration/tasks/{id}/assign/` - Assign task to agent
- `POST /api/v1/orchestration/tasks/{id}/retry/` - Retry failed task

### Monitoring Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/orchestration/status/metrics/` - Detailed metrics
- `GET /api/v1/orchestration/health/` - System health metrics
- `GET /api/v1/orchestration/execution-logs/` - Task execution logs

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Test Suite

```bash
# Test the complete system
python test_orchestration.py

# Test specific deployment failure
python enhanced_orchestrator.py --test-failure test-deploy-001

# Check system status
python enhanced_orchestrator.py --status
```

### Expected Results

The test demonstrates:
- ✅ 5 active agents with specialized capabilities
- ✅ Automatic task creation from deployment failures
- ✅ Intelligent agent assignment (DeploymentAgent-Primary selected)
- ✅ Task priority and status management
- ✅ Real-time system monitoring

## 🔄 Production Usage

### Continuous Operation

For production deployment, run the orchestration engine as a service:

```bash
# Start orchestration engine
python manage.py run_orchestration --interval 30

# Monitor logs
tail -f logs/orchestration.log
```
