## Pre-Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Copy `.env.production.template` to `.env`
- [ ] Update all production environment variables
- [ ] Generate new SECRET_KEY for production
- [ ] Configure database connection string
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates (see HTTPS_SETUP.md)
- [ ] Configure domain and ALLOWED_HOSTS
- [ ] Enable HTTPS security settings (SSL_REDIRECT, secure cookies)
- [ ] Update CORS and CSRF trusted origins for HTTPS

### 2. Database Setup
- [ ] Create production PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
- [ ] Create superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
- [ ] Load initial data if needed

### 3. Static Files & Media
- [ ] Configure static file serving (nginx/whitenoise)
- [ ] Set up media file storage
- [ ] Test file uploads work correctly

### 4. Frontend Deployment
- [ ] Build production frontend: `npm run build`
- [ ] Configure frontend hosting (nginx/CDN)
- [ ] Update CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS with production URLs
- [ ] Test frontend connects to backend API

### 5. HTTPS/SSL Configuration
- [ ] Generate or obtain SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt recommended)
- [ ] Run: `./setup_ssl.sh yourdomain.com`
- [ ] Update nginx configuration with domain name
- [ ] Test HTTPS redirects work correctly
- [ ] Verify security headers are present
- [ ] Test SSL certificate validity
- [ ] Configure certificate auto-renewal
- [ ] Update frontend API URLs to use HTTPS

### 6. Security Configuration
- [ ] Enable HTTPS redirect
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Set up proper cookie security
- [ ] Configure CSRF settings
- [ ] Review CORS configuration

### 6. Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Configure production logging
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry recommended)
- [ ] Configure log rotation
- [ ] Set up health check endpoints

### 7. Backup Strategy
- [ ] Configure automated database backups
- [ ] Set up media file backups
- [ ] Test backup restoration process
- [ ] Document backup procedures

### 8. Performance Tuning
- [ ] Configure Redis caching if needed
- [ ] Set up database connection pooling
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Optimize gunicorn settings

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Admin interface accessible
- [ ] API endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] User authentication working
- [ ] File uploads functional
- [ ] All business entities CRUD operations working

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Response times acceptable
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Static files loading correctly
- [ ] No memory leaks detected

### Security Testing
- [ ] HTTPS working properly
- [ ] Security headers present
- [ ] CORS policies correct
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor error logs daily
- [ ] Check database performance weekly
- [ ] Review backup integrity monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies quarterly

### Scaling Considerations
- [ ] Monitor CPU and memory usage
- [ ] Plan for database scaling
- [ ] Consider CDN for static files
- [ ] Plan for load balancing if needed

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Plan
- [ ] Document current deployment process
- [ ] Create rollback procedures
- [ ] Test rollback in staging environment
- [ ] Maintain previous version backups

### Contact Information
- [ ] System administrator contacts
- [ ] Database administrator contacts
- [ ] Hosting provider support
- [ ] Development team contacts
