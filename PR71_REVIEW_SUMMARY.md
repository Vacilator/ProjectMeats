```

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use:
1. **Verify your script version**: Run `python3 verify_deployment_fixes.py`
2. **Check environment**: Run `sudo ./verify_deployment_readiness.sh`

- Run test scripts to validate your environment
- Ensure clean deployment directory (`/opt/projectmeats`)

## Conclusion

**PR #71 review: COMPLETE AND SUCCESSFUL**

The merge was properly completed and all fixes are integrated. The deployment errors you encountered should no longer occur when using the current version of `master_deploy.py`.
