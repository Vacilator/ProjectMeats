## Tips for Success

### Database Passwords
- Choose a strong password with letters, numbers, and symbols
- Keep it secure - you'll need it for any future database access
- The system will test connectivity automatically

### Domain Configuration
- Use your actual domain name (not IP address) for proper SSL/HTTPS
- Include both `domain.com` and `www.domain.com` if needed
- DNS should already point to your server

### Email Configuration  
- Gmail users: Use "App Passwords" instead of your regular password
- Can be skipped during deployment and configured later
- Used for system notifications and password resets

### Company Information
- Used in email templates and system branding  
- All fields are optional but improve user experience
- Can be updated later by modifying the .env file
