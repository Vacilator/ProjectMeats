- Added PYTHONPATH to ensure proper module imports
- Multiple environment file sources for redundancy

## 🛠️ Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Run diagnostics to identify issues
sudo ./diagnose_deployment.sh

# 2. Fix all identified issues
sudo ./enhanced_django_service_fix.sh

# 3. Validate the deployment
sudo ./test_deployment.sh
```

### Using the Management Console
```bash
# Comprehensive management interface
sudo ./deployment_manager.sh help

# Quick health check
sudo ./deployment_manager.sh health

# Emergency recovery
sudo ./deployment_manager.sh emergency-restart
```

### Individual Tool Usage
```bash
# Detailed diagnostics
sudo ./diagnose_deployment.sh

# Service fixes
sudo ./enhanced_django_service_fix.sh

# Deployment validation
sudo ./test_deployment.sh
```

## 📊 Validation Results

### Backend Testing
- ✅ All 104 Django tests passing
- ✅ Database migrations working correctly
- ✅ API endpoints functional
- ✅ Static file collection working

### Script Testing
- ✅ Diagnostic script identifies all major issues
- ✅ Fix script handles error conditions gracefully
- ✅ Test script provides comprehensive coverage
- ✅ Management console provides unified interface

## 🔄 Deployment Workflow

The implemented solution follows this workflow:

1. **Diagnosis Phase** (`diagnose_deployment.sh`)
   - Analyzes system state
   - Identifies specific issues
   - Provides actionable recommendations

2. **Fix Phase** (`enhanced_django_service_fix.sh`)
   - Implements fixes with error handling
   - Validates each step before proceeding
   - Provides detailed progress feedback

3. **Validation Phase** (`test_deployment.sh`)
   - Comprehensive testing of all components
   - Performance and security validation
   - Detailed reporting with recommendations

4. **Management Phase** (`deployment_manager.sh`)
   - Ongoing service management
   - Health monitoring
   - Emergency recovery procedures

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

For immediate service recovery:
```bash
# Emergency restart with cleanup
sudo ./deployment_manager.sh emergency-restart

# Full service reset
sudo ./deployment_manager.sh emergency-reset

# Manual recovery sequence
sudo systemctl stop projectmeats
sudo pkill -f gunicorn
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start projectmeats
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

The implementation addresses all issues identified in the original delegation plan:

- ✅ **Gunicorn exit code 1**: Fixed through proper environment and dependency setup
