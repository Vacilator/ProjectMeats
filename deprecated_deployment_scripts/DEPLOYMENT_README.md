- **[DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md)** - Quick reference with links to main guide

## üóëÔ∏è Removed Files

The following fragmented files have been **removed** to eliminate confusion:
- `docs/production_deployment.md` (1060 lines)
- `docs/production_setup_guide.md` (212 lines)  
- `docs/production_deployment_overview.md` (230 lines)

All content has been consolidated into the single `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` guide.

## üéâ The Node.js Problem is SOLVED

**Previous Issue:**
```
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 nodejs : Conflicts: npm
 npm : Depends: node-cacache but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```

**Solution:** Our scripts now automatically:
1. ‚úÖ Stop all Node.js processes
2. ‚úÖ Remove ALL conflicting packages (including newer Ubuntu 22.04 versions)
3. ‚úÖ Clean package cache completely  
4. ‚úÖ Try multiple installation methods with fallbacks
5. ‚úÖ Verify installation before proceeding

## üöÄ Quick Start

**For most users:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vacilator/ProjectMeats/main/one_click_deploy.sh | sudo bash
```

**If you want to understand what's happening:**
1. Read `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. Run `python3 master_deploy.py` for interactive setup

**If you just want to fix Node.js and continue manually:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vacilator/ProjectMeats/main/fix_nodejs.sh | sudo bash
```

Your deployment process is now **simple, reliable, and automated**! üéØ
