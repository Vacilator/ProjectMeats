# ü§ñ Agent Orchestration System for ProjectMeats

## üéØ Overview

The ProjectMeats Agent Orchestration System enables multiple agents to work efficiently on the project without conflicts, providing automated task management, progress tracking, and visual dashboards for stakeholders.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Agents

### 1. Check Available Tasks
```bash
make agent-tasks              # All available tasks
make agent-tasks-priority     # High priority tasks only
```

### 2. Assign a Task to Yourself
```bash
make agent-assign TASK=TASK-001 AGENT=your_name
```

### 3. Update Progress
```bash
make agent-update TASK=TASK-001 AGENT=your_name STATUS=in_progress NOTES="Started debugging"
```

### 4. Complete the Task
```bash
make agent-update TASK=TASK-001 AGENT=your_name STATUS=completed NOTES="Fixed the bug and all tests pass"
```

### 5. Check for Conflicts (Before Starting)
```bash
make agent-conflicts TASK=TASK-006 AGENT=your_name
```

## üìä Status Monitoring

### For Agents
```bash
make agent-status             # Your current tasks and progress
make agent-project-status     # Overall project health
```

### For Stakeholders
```bash
make agent-dashboard          # Generate visual progress dashboard
make agent-progress-report    # Detailed progress report
```

## üìã Task Management Features

### ‚úÖ Conflict Prevention
- **File-level isolation**: Only one agent per file at a time
- **Dependency tracking**: Tasks must complete prerequisites first
- **Explicit conflict detection**: Warns about tasks that shouldn't run together

### üéØ Priority System
- **P0 (Critical)**: Blocking issues that prevent other work
- **P1 (High)**: Important features for project success
- **P2 (Medium)**: Valuable improvements
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice-to-have enhancements

### üìà Progress Tracking
- **Real-time status**: Available, In Progress, Blocked, Completed
- **Time estimation**: Hours estimated vs. actual completion
- **Agent performance**: Track individual and team productivity

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tasks

### üî• Critical Priority (P0)
- **TASK-001**: Fix failing purchase order creation test (3h)
- **TASK-002**: Add Jest tests for React components (10h)
- **TASK-003**: Set up automated test running in CI/CD (5h)

### ‚ö° High Priority (P1)
- **TASK-004**: Database query optimization audit (7h)
- **TASK-005**: Security validation and hardening (5h)

### üìã Medium Priority (P2)
- **TASK-006**: Modernize dashboard with business KPIs (10h)
- **TASK-007**: Implement responsive design system (14h)

*See [docs/agent_todo_system.md](docs/agent_todo_system.md) for complete task list*

## üö® Conflict Prevention Rules

### 1. File-Level Isolation
- Only one agent can modify a specific file at a time
- System automatically detects file conflicts before assignment

### 2. Entity Separation
- Different agents can work on different business entities simultaneously
- Example: One agent on Suppliers, another on Customers

### 3. Layer Separation
- Backend, Frontend, and DevOps work can proceed in parallel
- Clear boundaries between Django models, React components, and infrastructure

### 4. Dependency Management
- Tasks with dependencies must wait for prerequisites
- System enforces completion order automatically

## üìä Dashboard & Reporting

### Visual Progress Dashboard
The system generates a comprehensive dashboard showing:
- Overall project completion percentage
- Task status distribution with visual progress bars  
- Agent activity and performance metrics
- High priority tasks ready for assignment
- Current work in progress
- Recent completions and blockers

Access via:
```bash
make agent-dashboard          # Generate AGENT_PROGRESS_DASHBOARD.md
make agent-dashboard-json     # Include JSON metrics for APIs
```

### Progress Reports
Detailed text reports for stakeholder communication:
```bash
make agent-progress-report    # Comprehensive status report
```

## üéØ Agent Assignment Strategy

### üîÑ Daily Workflow
1. **Morning Standup**: Check `make agent-status` and `make agent-tasks-priority`
2. **Task Selection**: Choose highest priority task that fits your skills
3. **Conflict Check**: Run `make agent-conflicts` before starting
4. **Assignment**: Use `make agent-assign` to claim the task
5. **Progress Updates**: Regular `make agent-update` with meaningful notes
6. **Completion**: Mark as completed with validation criteria met

### üè∑Ô∏è Specialization Areas
- **Backend Specialists**: Django models, APIs, database optimization
- **Frontend Specialists**: React components, UI/UX, testing
- **DevOps Specialists**: CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure
- **Security Specialists**: Authentication, authorization, vulnerability scanning
- **Full-Stack Specialists**: End-to-end features spanning backend and frontend

### ‚è∞ Time Management
- **Short Tasks (2-6h)**: Can be completed in one session
- **Medium Tasks (8-12h)**: Split into 1-2 days with progress updates
- **Long Tasks (16-24h)**: Break into smaller sub-tasks when possible

## üìù Communication Protocols

### Required Logging
All agents must update the [agent activity log](docs/agent_activity_log.md):
- When starting work (objectives and planned items)
- At progress milestones
- When completing tasks
- When encountering blockers

### Status Updates
Use the orchestration system for formal status:
```bash
make agent-update TASK=TASK-XXX AGENT=your_name STATUS=status NOTES="Detailed progress description"
```

### Conflict Resolution
If conflicts arise:
1. Report via `make agent-update` with status "blocked"
2. Coordinate with other agents through activity log
3. Adjust timing or split work as needed

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Structure
Tasks are stored in `docs/agent_tasks.json` with:
- Task metadata (title, priority, estimate, files affected)
- Dependencies and conflicts
- Assignment and progress tracking
- Agent performance metrics

### Automation Features
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatic file and dependency conflict checking
- **Progress Tracking**: Time tracking and completion rates
- **Report Generation**: Automated dashboard and status reports
- **Validation**: Task completion criteria verification

### Integration Points
- **Make Commands**: Easy CLI access to all functionality
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD integration for task validation
- **Markdown Reports**: Stakeholder-friendly progress communication
- **JSON APIs**: Programmatic access to metrics and status
