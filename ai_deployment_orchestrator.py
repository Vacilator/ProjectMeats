AI Deployment Orchestrator (Bridge to Enhanced Orchestrator)
============================================================

This file serves as a bridge/compatibility layer to maintain CI/CD pipeline 
compatibility while directing calls to the actual enhanced orchestrator system.

This ensures backward compatibility while preserving the enhanced functionality
that has been developed in the enhanced_orchestrator.py and unified_deployment_tool.py.
